These improved versions address third-party services more explicitly, include more details on data protection and user rights, and provide clearer information on payment processing and refunds. This should help with approvals from payment gateways and app stores. However, it's still advisable to have these documents reviewed by a legal professional to ensure they meet all legal requirements in your jurisdiction and adequately protect your business.
